# A Collection of Useful Notebooks

This is a collection of various notebooks I've curated from the web or have authored. It covers a broad range of topics from LLMs, data science packages, Music to Bitcoin. 

Coding and doing so in notebooks is a very powerful way to learn (and teach). I learnt a ton from these notebooks and hope others will find these equally useful.
